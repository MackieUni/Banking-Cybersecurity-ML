# 🛡️ Banking Cybersecurity ML System  
**Network Intrusion Detection & Log Anomaly Detection**  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project implements a **world-class AI-powered cybersecurity system** specifically designed for the **banking and financial services sector**.  
It addresses two critical challenges:  
1. **Network Intrusion Detection** using **Random Forest + XGBoost (ensemble)**.  
2. **Log Anomaly Detection** using **Isolation Forest + LSTM (hybrid approach)**.  

The system was developed in **Google Colab** as part of the *AI in Finance* course (Final Project, Group 9), showcasing advanced skills in **machine learning, anomaly detection, and financial cybersecurity**.
